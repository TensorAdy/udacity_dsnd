# Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone Project

## Introduction 

A fictional music streaming company, called Sparkify has a problem of churn. In this Capstone Project, we are provided with a dataset to understand the causes of churn and then build a model which has relevant features for predicting customer churn utilizing Apache Spark.

### Analyis :
A technical analysis on exploring the data, feature engineering, modeling building and evaluation can be found here ** [Medium blog]() **

### Dataset 
* Format : JSON
* 543705
* Datset medium-sparkify-event-data.json available on Udacity Platform

### File descriptions 
The churn modeling is available in the Jupyter notebook [sparkify.ipynb](https://github.com/TensorAdy/udacity_dsnd/blob/master/Capstone-Sparkify/sparkify.ipynb)

### Environment 
* Jupyter Notebook on IBM watson cloud 
* Spark version	- 2.4
* Python 3.6

### Packages 
* pyspark
* numpy
* datetime
* matplotlib
* seaborn

### Approach 

* Clean the dataset 
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
* Define Churn 
* Identify important features through feature Engineering 
* Build diffrent Models to predict churn 
* Evaluate the models fine tune them
* Suggest further model improvements
