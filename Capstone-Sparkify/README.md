## Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone Project

### Introduction 

A fictional music streaming company, called Sparkify has a problem of churn. In this Capstone Project, we are provided with a dataset to understand the causes of churn and then build a model which has relevant features for predicting customer churn utilizing Apache Spark.

### Analyis
A technical analysis on exploring the data, feature engineering, modeling building and evaluation can be found here : [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@adiithya.h/predicting-customer-churn-with-spark-d899fbe0fd9)

### Dataset 
* Format : JSON
* 543,705 Events 
* Datset **medium-sparkify-event-data.json** available on Udacity Platform

### File descriptions 
* The churn modeling is available under Capstone-Sparkify folder in the Jupyter notebook format [sparkify.ipynb](https://github.com/TensorAdy/udacity_dsnd/blob/master/Capstone-Sparkify/sparkify.ipynb)
* It's also available on the [IBM watson cloud platform](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/5a014afb-4d6c-47fa-8b3d-f8a044fb9db2/view?access_token=20dc97d2323d16aec720b08962f1cbbeea906c4aa0cdcac2816986b89b03c79f)

### Environment 
* Jupyter Notebook on IBM watson cloud 
* Spark 2.4
* Python 3.6

### Packages 
* pyspark
* numpy
* datetime
* matplotlib
* seaborn

### Approach 

* Clean the dataset 
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
* Define Churn 
* Identify important features through feature engineering 
* Build diffrent Models to predict churn 
* Evaluate the models, fine tune them
* Suggest further model improvements
