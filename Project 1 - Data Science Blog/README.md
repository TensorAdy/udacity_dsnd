# Understanding Netflix Movies and TV Shows 
## Project Motivation 
Utilizing CRISP-DM, explore the dataset containing tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019 as a part of Udacity's [Data Science Nanodegree](https://in.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) 
The data for analyis is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows)
## Four questions that will be explored in the dataset :
* Which countries are have the most content on Netflix?
* How is the Nextflix content growing with regards to Movies and TV Shows?
* Which are the Top TV Shows by season ?
* Can you build a simple recommender for TV shows and movies? if so build one 
### Installation :
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn
* nltk
### File descriptions :
* netflix_titles.csv is the dataset used for analysis
* Netflix_2019 .ipynb is the analysis
### Results :
The key learnings from the analysis are :
* The most content on Netflix is avilable in United States both for TV Shows as well as Movies
* The Movies added to Nexflix over the years signifcantly outpaces the TV Shows on the platform
* Based on the description provided for each Movie and TV Show one can utlize NLP techniques to build a performing recommender system
* There are more TV Shows than Movies for the 'TV-Y7' rating that's suitable for children 

The findings can be found in the Jupyter Notebook [Netflix_2019](https://github.com/TensorAdy/udacity_dsnd/blob/master/Project%201%20-%20Data%20Science%20Blog/Netflix_2019%20.ipynb)
